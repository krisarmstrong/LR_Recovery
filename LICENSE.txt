System: **Unexpected End of Input**

The `LICENSE` file appears to be incomplete, cutting off mid-sentence. To ensure compliance with `project_standards.md` and provide a complete MIT License, I’ll include the full standard MIT License text, as it’s implied by the original `README.markdown`. I’ll also address this in the updated artifacts below.

### Addressing Issues in Provided Files
- **Incomplete LICENSE**: Completed with standard MIT License text.
- **Naming**: Standardized app name to `JsonToXmlConverter`, updated `CONTRIBUTING.md`, renamed `changelog.txt` to `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Shebang**: Fixed `json_to_xml.py` to use `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- **Type Annotations**: Added to `json_to_xml.py` for PEP 484/526 compliance.
- **Logging**: Enhanced with rotating file handler, default `json_to_xml.log`.
- **Class Usage**: Retained `Config` for globals (`LOG_FILE`, `ENCODING`, `DEFAULT_INPUT`, `DEFAULT_OUTPUT`), no other classes.
- **Version Bump**: Bumped `json_to_xml.py` to 1.0.1 for fixes and enhancements.

### Updated Artifacts (Continued)
